To understand how many moves there are in a given dimension, 
think of a square and how many there to get from the middle 
to the edges and how precise you want to be. For example, on
a flat square you can go four ways (to every corner) and four
more with the edges. On a cube there are eight corners, twelve
edges and six faces, so twenty six possible ways.
There are four Python scripts, two for 2D and two for 3D
(both with and without fancy movements).
